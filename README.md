This web application, built on Flask, allows users to upload images for analysis, identifying the top 10 colors in RGB, Hex, or CMYK formats.

The "app.py" file, written in Python and utilizing Flask, processes uploaded images to extract and display the top 10 colors in RGB, Hex, or CMYK format.

The "index.html" file serves as the HTML template used by the Flask application to render the web page, enabling users to upload images and view the extracted color palette.
